                    <h3 class="projecthd">Berkeley Seniors Project</h3>
                    <p>For my master's final project I was a member of a team working with the City of Berkeley's Aging Services Division to support social services delivery to senior residents. This project produced a report to the City's IT department with recommendations for further technology development after prototyping and testing a proposed system. Placing the user at the center, we got an in-depth understanding of the organization and then translated that into concrete designs which were tested with users. This project makes use of the broad range of skills gained at the I School, technical understanding, social research, and business process analysis.</p>

                    <h3 class="projecthd">Project Bamboo</h3>
                    <p>A Qualitative research project focused on the technology practices of humanities scholars in higher education. For this study I interviewed faculty, graduate students and staff and coordinated focus groups. I was a member of a team composed of three other graduate students and two faculty advisors from the UC Berkeley School of Information. The academic community as a whole, and the humanities in particular, is a fantastic a microcosm in which to examine the diffusion of technology. One of the study goals was to generate design recommendations for future development of tools and infrastructure to support humanities scholarship, and a report on our analysis of the collected data is forthcoming.</p>

                    <h3 class="projecthd">Context Finder</h3>
                    <p>As a part of the <a href="http://ecai.org/neh2007/">Context and Relationships: Ireland and Irish Studies</a> project I've done a background literature review, a technology survey (a part of which can be seen here: <a href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~kersey/gallery/demo/readerInterface.htm">reading interfaces gallery</a>), and have written a detailed specification for developing software which will augment online texts to give the reader more streamlined access to trusted reference materials. I also developed a survey and assessment protocol, gained Institutional Review Board approval, and will commencing testing during the latter half of the Spring 2010 semester.</p>

                    <h3 class="projecthd">Open Context</h3>
                    <p><a href="http://www.opencontext.org">Open Context</a> is a site for archeologists and cultural heritage professionals to share and store primary data sets. In the past, much of what was created during an excavation or survey was not easily accessible to others outside the research group or museum which housed the physical artifacts. Open Context is changing that. As a graduate student researcher I did a literature and technology review to determine what kinds of tools for collaboration and visualization around primary data existed. I also did a user needs analysis based on material from a workshop held locally, and based on that, designed, did wireframes, and built a widget which acted as a badge, allowing a user to show how much they had contributed on any external website with a simple copy and paste, updated dynamically.</p>

                    <p>A research paper which approaches YouTube from a number of different angles, looking at the contradictions inherent in the private ownership of a cultural archive of this magnitude. The philosophical roots which drive much of the rhetoric about it in the popular press is traced through history, and more recent questions about the sustainability of global scale video distribution are examined.
